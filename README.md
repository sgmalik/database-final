To set up database:
Run database_set_up.py
Once you have generated the database:
Run app.py, follow the link that is generated in the console to the web page

NOTE TO THE GRADER:
Our project is designed to run with a lot more than 500 rows in the Game and Player tables. This means that when using our app with the shortened database, the graphs might look a little skewed, also the queries might return less information than they normally would.
