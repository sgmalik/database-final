# ideas for queries
- which team has the most wins?

- which team averages the most points per game?

# visuals
- bar chart of team wins
- bar chart of player points

# using joins
- join team and game on team_id to show how many wins each team had in a given season
- join player and game on player_id to show how many points each player scored in a given season
